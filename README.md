# Kode Karma

## Overview:
Kode Karma is a full stack Ruby on Rails application connecting digital talent with area non-profits.
It incorporates not only MVC, REST, and CRUD, but it also uses multiple table inheritance through polymorphism on the Devise User model.

## Project Notes:
I wanted to create this app because most non-profit organizations do not have access to quality resources for producing web and mobile content.
As a current coder, I want to aid our community through area non-profits, but as a coder it is difficult to identify organizations who need your skill set for a project.
As a former non-profit admin, I know first hand how difficult it is to find digital talent that wants to interface with a non-profit directly.
