# !(kodeKarma.png "logo") Kode Karma

## Overview:
Kode Karma is a full stack Ruby on Rails application connecting digital talent with area non-profits.
It incorporates not only MVC, REST, and CRUD, but it also uses multiple table inheritance through polymorphism on the Devise User model.

## Project Notes:
I wanted to create this app because most non-profit organizations do not have access to quality resources for producing web and mobile content.
As a former non-profit admin and a current coder, non-profits are near and dear to me.

## Technologies Used:
+ HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Rails 4, Postgresql, Devise Gem, Materialize Gem, Active Record
+ Design - Adobe Illustrator, wireframe.cc
+ Frameworks - Materialize Css
+ Project Planning & User Stories - [Trello](https://trello.com/b/b4sKX3VN/kode-karma)
+ Sublime Text 3
